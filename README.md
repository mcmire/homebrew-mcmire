# homebrew-mcmire

Homebrew formulae that I've forked to get around incompatibility issues.

## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install mcmire/mcmire/<formula>`

Or `brew tap mcmire/mcmire` and then `brew install <formula>`.

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
